# Drivers of Profit Margin in the Global Superstore Dataset

This repository contains the materials for my final project.  
The goal is to understand where profit margin is high or low in the Global Superstore dataset
and which factors drive these differences.

## Contents

- `project2.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook that loads the data, cleans it, runs the analysis, and generates the main 4-panel figure
  *“Drivers of profit margin in the Global Superstore dataset”*.

- `project2.pdf`  
  Final three-page report submitted for the course.  
  It includes the integrated figure, legend, findings, data & methods, and significance statement.

- `Dataset/`  
  Global Superstore dataset used in the analysis (CSV file and related resources).

## How to run

1. Open `project2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab).
2. Make sure Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are installed.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom to reproduce the data cleaning, analysis and plots.

The notebook will regenerate the main 4-panel figure used in the report.
